Originally, our intention was to use One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding, however found out that they are not suitable for our dataset due to the fact that:

If your data is nominal (no inherent order), label encoding can mislead algorithms like K-means, which will treat the numbers as if they have mathematical meaning
